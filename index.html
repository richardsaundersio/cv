            I am an inhouse recruitment specialist who has experience of
            recruiting in the UK, across Europe, and now in my new home,
            America. I have a strong record of helping companies build effective
            internal functions, but my main love is sourcing.
            <br />
            <br />
            If I'm not at work, you will probably find me at a concert in Boston
            (I moved here in 2018), watching Premiership football or trying out
            a new beer.
