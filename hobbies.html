        I love watching football. I have the misfortune of being a Reading FC
        fan.

      <li>
        I go to lots of concerts (remember them?!) and love all types of music.

      <li>
        I love learning new things - I'm currently working on a python course,
        alongside an HTML, CSS and Javascript course (hence this website!).
